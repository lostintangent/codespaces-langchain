# 🦜🔗 Codespaces LangChain Template

This template provides a one-click dev environment for building "LLM apps" with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), Codespaces, and GPT-3. With it, you'll get [free access](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-09-codespaces-for-free-and-pro-accounts/) to a VS Code-based web editor, complete with a fully-configured Python playground, that includes the neccessary SDKs, libraries, and IDE extensions 🐱‍💻

## Getting Started

1. Create a codespace for this templates.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/lostintangent/codespaces-langchain?resume=1)

1. Once you're within the web editor, simply open any of the notebooks within the `/examples` folder, and select `Run All` in the notebook's toolbar. From there, you can change any of the prompts and/or code, and then re-run the cell/notebook, in order to get a better intuition for how LangChain can help you build your own custom chains 🚀

> Optionally, if you'd like to explore the sample that automates Google search qierues, create an account with [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/), generate an API key, and set it as a Codespaces secret called `SERPAPI_API_KEY`.
